This application can show the benefit DataRobot can provide a manual reviewer 'drowning in alerts'. Due to compliance reasons often there is a manual review required of AML alerts (generated by a rules based system).  DatRobot can make the processing of these alerts more efficient and reduce the false positive rate. This uses the Anti-Money Laundering dataset.

The anomaly score can compliment the classification model and potentially catch different fraudulant observations. Can make for a good story if fraudulant actors 'adapt their behavior.'
